# Introduction to tastyFood app

## Demo
The API has a daily limit, so there is a possibility that once it is used, there is need to wait until the next day to use the app. Although, when writing the project, I saved some of the data in localStorage, but during deployment I eventually abandoned this.

## Description

A simple application written in React in which the user can search for a meal for themselves via a search box, or select one given on the homepage. The main purpose of writing the app was to use an external API and work with the data obtained through it.

React, styled-components, API 


## Lessons Learned
Although I have used an external API before, for example in a weather app, further practice with different documentation has given me confidence. As this is the first time I have used the framer-motion and splide animation libraries in a project, I can say that implementing them was a learning experience.
